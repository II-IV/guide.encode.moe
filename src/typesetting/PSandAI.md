# Masking using AI and PS
# Preface

So before we get to know on how to work with AI,
I would like to give a small warning.
AI is really advanced, powerful tool in TSing
and if you use it carelessly
it may cause *Exploooooooooooosion.gif*
since it is **heavy** to render on toasters and potatos.
This is something to keep in mind so make sure
you use it in *moderation* and try to avoid whenever you can.

My aim of writing this guide is to show basics of
Photoshop, Illustrator and it's relevant parts/functions
and give you a direction on to how to use AI and PS.

I assume you have all the software installed and ready to go.
And I also assume you know the basics of the Aegisub
so I will be skipping the detail explanation of it.
If you don't, I implore you to read the infamous [unanimated guide][].
