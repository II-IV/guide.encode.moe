# Preface

Most of the guide is written by me (gsk\_)
so if you see any pronouns such as "I", "me", "my" etc. it is refers to [gsk\_](https://github.com/gsk143), unless otherwise stated.
So before we get to know on how to work with AI,
I would like to give a small warning.
AI is really advanced, powerful tool in TSing
and if you use it carelessly
it may cause _Exploooooooooooosion.gif_
since it is **heavy** to render on toasters.
This is something to keep in mind so make sure
you use it in _moderation_ and try to avoid whenever you can.

My aim of writing this guide is to show basics of
Photoshop, Illustrator and it's relevant parts/functions
and give you a direction on to how to use them.
Through out the guide I will be abbrevating
**Photoshop** as **PS** and Adobe **Illustrator** as **AI**.

I assume you have all the software installed and ready to go.
And I also assume you know the basics of the Aegisub
so I will be skipping the detail explanation of it.
If you don't, I implore you to read the infamous [unanimated guide][].
